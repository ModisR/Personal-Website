I would pay cash to see these scientists explaining to their investors what the research money is being used for:
<br><br>
<strong>Up in a flash</strong>
<br>
Hit the light. Male rats have been engineered to develop erections when their genitals are illuminated with a blue lamp, often used to treat seasonal affective disorder. The lamp even made some rats ejaculate (<cite>Angewander Chemie, http:&#47;&#47;doi.org/f26psr</cite>). The team hopes the method will provide an alternative treatment for men with erectile dysfunction who don't respond to drugs like Viagra.
